## How to Brainstorm Story Ideas

- ### Homework for Life
    - Spend 5 minutes each day to write 2-3 sentences - not the entire story - of moments from the day
    - Don't worry of connecting threads of stories from previous days
- ### Crash & Burn
    - Spend 10 minutes to allow yourself to write your stream of conciousness/thoughts
    - Don't let your pen from stopping - let new ideas keep crashing in without hesitation or judgement
    - Be willing to leave a good idea behind in favour of a new one - even if the new idea is bad
- ### First, Best, Last, Worst
    - A story against each of these prompts e.g. `First/Best/Last/Worst Car`
    - Annotate any as potential story or anecdote
    - But not all listed will be story worthy
