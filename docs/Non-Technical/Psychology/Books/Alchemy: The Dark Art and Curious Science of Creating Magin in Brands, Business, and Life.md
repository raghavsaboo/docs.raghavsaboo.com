## Overview

The main premise of the book is that while science and logic has resulted in immensely valuable products, there is a
treasure trove still waiting to be discovered by applying apparently illogical solutions to human problems.

- Just because the scientific methodology has been so reliable it does not have to be the only tool to apply especially
  to a messy field like human behaviour.
- *"Engineering does not allow for magic. Psychology does."*
- Rory defines the way humans make decisions as "psycho-logic" - to distinguish it from the concepts of "logic" and "
  rationality"
- The idea is to become adept at spotting instances where the "universal laws" don't apply - when abandoning logic is
  sensible

A 4x4 matrix that can be plotted of human advances / ideas that fall on a spectrum between FAILS to WORKS and SEEMS
WEIRD to MAKES SENSE.

e.g. Bicycles definitely work but are at the same time very weird - humans have learned how to ride bicycles but it is
not built in a "logical" manner.
