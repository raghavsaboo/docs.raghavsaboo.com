# Abstract Base Class

A formal mechanism to designate the relationships between different implementations of the same abstractionis through the definition of one class that serves as an **abstract base class**, via inheritance, for one or more **concrete classes**.

The abstract base class may not have any concrete methods implemented, but still define expectations of methods that should exit as **abstract** methods. The subclasses that inherit the abstract base class are responsible for overriding abstract methods to provide a working implementation for each behaviour.
