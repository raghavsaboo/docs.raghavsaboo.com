Whenever there is a component of optimization in the question, i.e. when the following words are used

1. "Can we reach this answer"
2. "minimize/maximize"
3. "longest/shortest"
4. "largest/smallest"

you should consider [Greedy](../greedy.md) or [Dynamic Programming](../dynamic%20programming.md) approaches.
