    "In Python, each time a function (recursive or otherwise) is called, a structure known as an **activation record** or **frame** is created to store information about the progress of that invocation of the function. This activation record includes a namespace for storing the function call's parameters and local variables, and information about which command in the body of the function is currently executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the execution of a function leads to a nested function call, the execution of the former call is suspended and its activation record stores the place in the source code at which the flow of control should continue upon return of the nested call. This process is used both in the standard case of one function calling a different function, or in the recursive case in which a function invokes itself. The key point is that there is a different activation record for each active cell.\n",
