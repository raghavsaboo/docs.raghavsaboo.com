## Introduction

Data intensive applications typically feature common building blocks:
- Databases: a store for data
- Caches: speed up reads for expensive operations
- Search Indices: filter or search data efficiently
- Stream Processing: asynchrounous operations and messaging between processes
- Batch Processing: periodic processing of accumulated data
