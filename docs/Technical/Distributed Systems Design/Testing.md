# Testing

There are different types of tests that serve different purposes and are often used collectively in modern systems.

## Functional Testing: Tests that Validate Correctness of a System
These tests are used to verify inputs and outputs of a system.

The difference between these tess is **scope** of the test in terms of components. Usually there are many unit tests, fewer integration tests, and even fewer system tests.
