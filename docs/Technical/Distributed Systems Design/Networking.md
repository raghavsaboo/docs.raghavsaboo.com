# Networking

**Communication Protocols** that standardize message formats and rules about how these messages should be sent and received are composed of layers. Each layer provides a specific function to the layer above it, but each layer is encapsulated; in other words, it does not need to know how the other layers work.

Two major models describe these layers: the **OSI (Open System Interconnect) model** and the **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model**.

The TCP/IP model is a simplified implementation of the OSI model - and it has four layers (compared to seven in the OSI model). It defines how data is transmitted from one computer to another, and how a computer should be connected to the internet. Its design allows for high communication reliability through an unreliable network.

Each layer in the TCP/IP model has protocols, which each describe the message formats and rules that pertain to the later.
