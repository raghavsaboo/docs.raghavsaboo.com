## Overview

The process of syncing data between databases in a consistent way is refered to as
"replication".

This is needed due to a few reasons:

- Resilience of service to Machine Failures
- Improving latency for global audience
- Scaling to millions of users
- Offline/Network failures

## Types of Replication

### 1. Single Leader

### 2. Multi-Leader

### 3. Leaderless
